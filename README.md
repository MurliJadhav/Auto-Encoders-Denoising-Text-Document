# What is Denoising Autoencoder?

Denoising Autoencoders are an enxtension of simple autoencoders.
Denoising autoencoders can be used for the purposes of image denoising.
Autoencoders are able to cancel out the noise in images before learning
important features and reconstructing the sharp crisp images back.

This is specially very useful for image processing applications, such as 
classification and object detection/recognition tasks.
